# Nomic
Nomic is a meta game, where rules are the main subject of game

From a software engineer's perspective, a Nomic game is a fascinating exercise in dynamic rule manipulation akin to an ever-evolving codebase. It's a game in which the rules, including the rules for changing the rules, are decided and modified by the players as part of the gameplay. Much like developing software, where requirements may change, new features may need to be added, or bugs fixed, Nomic involves continuously adapting and optimizing the system. This strategic game offers an engaging playground for honing key skills, like logical thinking, adaptation, and understanding of how small changes can lead to significant shifts in the system's behavior, mirroring the complexities of software development and maintenance.
